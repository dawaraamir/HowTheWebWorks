How the Web Works Notes
- Websites are stored on a sever
- IP (Internet Protocol) 
- User searches for a browser (url request) which is checked by a DNS Server (translates domain to ip) which then the server (stores/generates) the website
- The three languages you see in a browser are HTML (hypertext markup language: gives website structure), CSS (cascading style sheets: makes the look of the website), & JavaScript (logic to website example drop downs, tabs, etc.)
-  HTTP (hypertext transfer protocol) and S in HTTPS means its secure
- Frameworks allow utility for method writing to make it easier for coders to develop certain functions quicker
- Web sends and receives HTML through server but apps send and typically get back JSON (javascript object notation: data format)
